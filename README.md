## Intro to the tracker

**[My Book Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1noaY8asMGTL2dy_2B2YBe3vP4V0wMp4mZLGTtIwRupc/edit?usp=sharing)**

I began working on this tracker in 2021 because I was curious about my reading habits and I wanted statistics to back up my original assumptions.

I utilized Google Sheets because I knew that my access to the Microsoft Office Suite will be cut off after I graduated, so I assembled my tracker in a tool that operates similarily to Google Sheets.

**Note:** The file will not function on Excel. Certain formulas utilized are specific to Google Sheets and will break if it is downloaded as an Excel file.
