## My tracker (last update: August 2024)

**[My Book Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1noaY8asMGTL2dy_2B2YBe3vP4V0wMp4mZLGTtIwRupc/edit?usp=sharing)**

I started this reading tracker in 2021 out of a curiosity to better understand my reading habits, and to gather data that could support my initial assumptions.

I chose Google Sheets for this project because I anticipated losing access to the Microsoft Office Suite after graduation. This led me to build the tracker in a platform that closely mirrors Excel.

**Note:** This tracker is not completely compatible as an Excel document. Some of the formulas are unique to Google Sheets and will not function correctly if the file is downloaded.

After learning Power BI, I developed a dashboard to provide a clearer and more comprehensive view of my reading habits. I typically update these trackers at the end of each month.

Each page shows unique information. Please see below

### Homepage
This page displays my overall reading statistics, with options to filter by date and page count. It includes a dynamically updating list of all the books I've read, which adjusts automatically based on the selected filters.

### Reading Stats #1 - Genres and Ratings
This page offers an in-depth analysis of my reading habits by categorizing the books I've read by genre. It also includes filters for genres and dates, allowing me to better understand my reading preferences.

### Reading Stats #2 - Authours and Other Info
This page features miscellaneous information about the authors I've read, including their gender and whether they are POC or non-POC (Person of Colour or Not a Person of Colour). Iâ€™ve also included a chart that compares the average rating for each month against the total pages and books read. In the graph below, any missing dates indicate months where I didn't read anything.
